font-roboto
============

Embedded version of `font-roboto` as a drop-in replacement for the ones as used by native polymer elements.

Just include a reference to this repository in your `bower.json` and make sure it gets preference over the ones installed by polymer.

Useful in situations where you want to create an offline version of an app, like `cordova`.
